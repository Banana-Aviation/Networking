How to give Internet access to IPVPN clients?
In current topology AS701 (Verizon) is playing a role of the Internet.
Should PEs have a default route to eBGP ASBR, and inject it into customer VRFs?
What is the best most scalable way to give internet access to customer sites, that easy to maintain and debug later on?
